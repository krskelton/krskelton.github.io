					<p>For the most part, a customers first impression is your website so it seems logical that you should have the latest, fanciest web design, right? Not necessarily. The decision to redesign a website should be carefully considered as there are costs and a lot of time involved in a full redesign.</p>

					<p>The general consensus among marketers and designers is that you should redesign your website every 2 to 3 years to remain current with your competitors. This may not be feasible for many smaller companies though. Will they be left in the dust? Again, this is not necessarily the case. Many sources believe that some companies might actually benefit more from making incremental changes to their website instead of a full redesign. One reason for this line of thinking is keeping your customers happy. Some companies change their website to a beautiful design with lots of bells and whistles and their customers can no longer navigate to important information easily.</p>

					<p>Inevitably if a website changes dramatically, you will have customer complaints. The initial shock of having to navigate through a site in a different way leads to a lot of frustration. However, it’s sometimes the very changes customers complain about after a redesign that become the most important part of the website later on. A great example of this is when Facebook’s news feed was introduced they received numerous complaints about the new feature, but it is now what makes the website so popular.</p>

					<p>I know, this sounds like conflicting information. The point is, there isn’t really an obvious yes or no answer to the question, should I redesign my website. Some things to consider that might make you want to answer yes are:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Your site no longer meets the needs of the user.</li>

						<li>Your site is not mobile friendly.</li>

						<li>Your site needs to increase it’s search ranking.</li>

						<li>Your site doesn’t have a clear call to action.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>If your site can answer yes to any of these, you might consider a redesign. These features are key to any modern website’s ability to satisfy the users.</p>

					<p>A good rule of thumb is that unless the changes made to a website will make the site work better and be more easy to use, then don’t change it.</p>
